<h1> Idea for the best Honeymoon/ 1st Anniversay </h1>
<body>
<p> St. Lucia is a Caribean Island filled with beautiful people, great food and amazing blue beaches. The resorts are catered to tourists from all over the globe with their up-to-date suites and all-inclusive amenities. One resort in particular that is a must see is called The Coconut Bay. My husband and I have planned our 1st Anniversary and that is our choice of destination. What attracted us most is their infinity pool which allows you to swim up to the bar to order a complimentart alcoholic beverage of your choice.</p>
